## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Stackoverflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I encountered while creating the Light and memory game was actually the start and end button.
When I started the code the button worked fine, but along the way the end button wouldn’tget me back to the start 
button after the game. I spent a day looking for what was the problem, jumping from html, to JavaScript, to CSS to 
see what the problem was and how I could fix it. I finally found that I made a mistake in JavaScript on the button functions 
for the stop Button. After going through stack overflow, I fixed the button and everything ran smoothly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
The questions that I have about web development are, how do you implement more complex designs like UI inside web development ? 
How do you get everything to run so smoothly from JS, CSS, and HTML and are they an easy language to learn? What’s the process 
like in making bigger games/websites? How do you get creative in web development? Is it hard to make a website from scratch?
How does UI and UX designs play a part in web development and is it important to have in making a website? What are rules that 
should be followed in order to be successful in web development? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would definitely look to add more features to the Game. Like adding a bonus round 
feature to the game so after you win you can opt in to a bonus round that will be more challenging. Another feature is instead of giving the user 
one chance to get the pattern right, they would get three “lives”. Each wrong pattern is a life lost. The last feature is to make levels and add more 
colors. We increase the speed and pattern of the game to make it more difficult on each level after each pattern you get right. The more and more you 
progress a new color will appear and the pattern will grow faster.
